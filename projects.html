        <p>Our program is a story-based adventure game in which
        the user chooses options at various points and their choices affect the outcome of the game. 
        This program was developed<br> in order to provide users with an entertaining experience of a game.
        </p>
        
        <p>The process of developing this game was long and tedious as we had to run tests many times at many points of development. Through these vigorous tests, my partner and I <br>learned techniques that made coding easier such as having one broadcast throughout the game that would do the same thing (in our case, it was a reset message). This <br>realization has taught me that I should make shortcuts for complicated code and that efficiency is a key idea in the field of computer science.</p>

         <p>This program is the game "Battleship" renivented using code developed by me and my partner Ethan Ravenstein.
         In this game, the user chooses coordinates for the length <br>of the ship and has those ships appear on a Battleship grid
         as 0's. The user would play against a bot that has their own grid and that grid shows any spots that the user has <br>hit or 
         miss. Hits are represented by X's and misses are represented by -'s. While the user can choose where to attack on the robot's
         grid, the robot will choose random <br>places on the user's grid.
         </p>
         <p>My partner and I went through several personal testing phases while developing our program, meaning we tested our program ourselves while developing it. The main strategy<br>we utilized to test our program was to develop the code in segments, test to see if the segment achieved the purpose we intended it to have, and if not, look back at the code <br>and tweak it as necessary. My partner and I had the most difficulty in having the user input coordinates in reverse order (i.e D1, C1). We decided to fix this problem by <br>prompting the user to “put the higher position first” and then allowing the user to re-input the coordinates correctly.

    <h1>AP Create Task: Bockey</h1>

         <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/294981561/" target="_blank">Play the game for yourself!</a></br>
            <p>This program is a multiplayer hockey simulation game that I have developed for my AP Computer
            Science Create Task. The game is able to be played by 2-4 players, with<br> each player contolling
            an individual athlete with their own unique controls. There is a Bang energy drink (all rights reserved) power up
            that would increase <br>the speed of the player that touched the power up.</p>
            <p>This program was created using an incremental and iterative process in which
            I would write a chunk of code, test it myself, and fix it if needed. One difficulty I 
            experienced <br>while developing this program was being able to restart the player and puck
            positions after a goal was scored. In order to fix this, I decided to utilize the
            broadcast system <br>in Scratch where a message would be brodacasted and recieved. resulting
            in a series of code to be activated.</p>
    <h1>Malware Exploration: Ramnit</h1>
        <iframe src="https://chinovalley-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ddelgado2_stu_chino_k12_ca_us/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={d9024583-27cb-420f-bf33-be4678de9eb9}&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777" width="962px" height="565px" frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com/webapps">Office Online</a>.</iframe>
        <p>This little project was a research and present type of project. As an individual, we were able to
        choose a type of malware to research and create a presentation on. <br>The type of malware I chose to research
        was the ramnit type. Information about the malware can be found in the presentation above.</p>
    <h1>Investigate with Data: Crimes</h1>

        <p>For this project, a partner and I were tasked with investigating a category of our choice.
        With the chosen category, we were to come up with multiple
        <br>
        questions in that field that we could answer
        by researching data. After extensive and thorough research, we collected enough data to answer our 
        <br>
        aforementioned questions and create visuals representing that data. The data for our
        project is based in the United States in 2015.</p>
        <p>
        </p>Figure 1: Figure 1 shows the percentage of crime 
        commited based on gender. From that figure, we can come to the conclusion that males commit more 
        <br>
        crime than  females.
        <br>
        Figure 2: Figure 2 demonstrates the how often a certain type of crime is committed; from this we can conclude
        that the most common crime in the 
        <br>
        United States is crimes involving drug abuse.
        <br>
        Figure 3: Figure 3 divides the frequency of crimes committed based on race. From this figure,
        we can conclude that white people commit the 
        <br>
        most crime in the United States,
        with African Americans coming in a close second.

    <h1>Simulations</h1>
    <h2>Rabbit Simulation</h2>
        <video src="videos/Bimulation.webm" height="720" width="1080" controls>
        <p>For this project, we used a smiulation tool called NetLogo to simulate
        scenarious regarding wildlife and their life cycles. My partner and I decided 
        to simulate an environment that homes rabbits, wolves, grass, and hemlock.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Heres how life works in our environment:
        <br>
        Rabbits Eat Grass</br><br>
        Wolves Eat Rabbits</br><br>
        Hemlock Poisons Rabbits<br><br>
        Grass Help Rabbit Repopulate</br>
