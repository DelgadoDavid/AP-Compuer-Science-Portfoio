        <p>Our program is a story-based adventure game in which
        the user chooses options at various points and their choices affect the outcome of the game. 
        This program was developed in order to provide users with an entertaining experience of a game.

        <p>The process of developing this game was long and tedious as we had to run tests many times at many points of development. Through these vigorous tests, my partner and I learned techniques that made coding easier such as having one broadcast throughout the game that would do the same thing (in our case, it was a reset message). This realization has taught me that I should make shortcuts for complicated code and that efficiency is a key idea in the field of computer science.</p>

         <p>This program is the game "Battleship" renivented using code developed by me and my partner Ethan Ravenstein.
         In this game, the user chooses coordinates for the length of the ship and has those ships appear on a Battleship grid
         as 0's. The user would play against a bot that has their own grid and that grid shows any spots that the user has hit or 
         miss. Hits are represented by X's and misses are represented by -'s. While the user can choose where to attack on the robot's
         grid, the robot will choose random places on the user's grid.
         </p>
         <p>My partner and I went through several personal testing phases while developing our program, meaning we tested our program ourselves while developing it. The main strategy we utilized to test our program was to develop the code in segments, test to see if the segment achieved the purpose we intended it to have, and if not, look back at the code and and tweak it as necessary. My partner and I had the most difficulty in having the user input coordinates in reverse order (i.e D1, C1). We decided to fix this problem by prompting the user to “put the higher position first” and then allowing the user to re-input the coordinates correctly.
